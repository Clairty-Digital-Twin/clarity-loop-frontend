**üöÄ PRODUCTION-READY CI/CD PIPELINE & APP STORE DEPLOYMENT**

**Objective:**
Create a bulletproof CI/CD pipeline for iOS health app deployment to App Store with automated testing, security scanning, and release management.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ 489 tests passing (98.9% success rate)
- ‚ùå No CI/CD pipeline 
- ‚ùå No automated App Store deployment
- ‚ùå No security scanning automation

**Required Implementation:**
@claude create a comprehensive CI/CD system including:

**1. GitHub Actions Workflows:**
- Automated testing on every PR
- Build verification for multiple iOS versions
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Code quality analysis with SwiftLint
- Automated dependency updates

**2. App Store Connect Integration:**
- Automated TestFlight builds
- App Store submission pipeline
- Version management automation
- Release notes generation

**3. Security & Compliance:**
- Automated security scanning with CodeQL
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- HealthKit compliance validation
- HIPAA compliance checks

**4. Performance Monitoring:**
- Automated performance testing
- Memory leak detection
- Launch time optimization
- Network performance validation

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `.github/workflows/` complete CI/CD setup
- [ ] Fastfile for iOS automation
- [ ] Security scanning integration
- [ ] App Store deployment automation
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation

**Priority:** HIGH - Required for production deployment
