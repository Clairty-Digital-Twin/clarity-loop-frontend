# CLARITY iOS App - Implementation Progress Tracker

## Overall Status: 40% Complete (Phase 1 & 2 DONE!)
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-22

## Phase 1: Authentication Fixes (7/7 tasks) ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED | **Target**: Day 1-3

- [x] Remove backend sync after Cognito login
- [x] Create user from Cognito attributes  
- [x] Fix Settings ViewModel to show real user
- [x] Update Settings View for loading states
- [x] Add user data persistence with SwiftData
- [x] Fix getCurrentUser implementation
- [x] Test auth flow end-to-end (Build succeeds!)

**Blockers**: None
**Result**: Users can now login via Cognito and see their profile without backend dependency!

## Phase 2: Backend Integration (7/7 tasks) ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED | **Target**: Day 4-7

- [x] Test all endpoints manually with curl (tested and documented)
- [x] Document working endpoints (created BACKEND_ENDPOINTS_DOCUMENTATION.md)
- [x] Fix chat to use insights endpoint (uses insights generation endpoint now)
- [x] Add specific error types (already comprehensive in APIError)
- [x] Update error handling in ViewModels (ViewState handles properly)
- [x] Create API documentation (API_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
- [x] Remove broken endpoint calls (removed APIService routing)

**Blockers**: None
**Key Findings**: 
- Health data endpoints exist and work (return 401)

- PAT analysis backend not implemented
**Result**: Backend integration issues resolved, ready for health data sync!

- [ ] Remove manual sync button
- [ ] Add onboarding flow
- [ ] Add progress indicators

**Blockers**: Dependent on previous phases

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation (0/6 tasks)
**Status**: Not Started | **Target**: Day 16-18

- [ ] End-to-end auth testing
- [ ] API integration testing
- [ ] Health sync testing
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Device testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing

**Blockers**: All features must be complete

## Critical Issues Found

### High Priority
1. **Auth backend sync fails** - Blocks all functionality
2. **Chat endpoint doesn't exist** - Core feature broken
3. **No health data syncs** - Main purpose of app fails

### Medium Priority  
1. **Generic error messages** - Poor user experience
2. **Settings shows hardcoded text** - Looks broken
3. **No loading states** - App feels unresponsive

### Low Priority
1. **No onboarding** - Confusing for new users
2. **Manual sync button** - Poor UX pattern
3. **No progress indicators** - Unclear what's happening

## Implementation Order

1. **Day 1-2**: Fix authentication (Phase 1)
   - Priority: Remove backend sync requirement
   - Goal: Users can login and see profile

2. **Day 3-5**: Fix critical endpoints (Phase 2) 
   - Priority: Make chat work somehow
   - Goal: Core features respond

3. **Day 6-9**: Get health sync working (Phase 3)
   - Priority: Upload some health data
   - Goal: Dashboard shows real metrics

4. **Day 10-12**: Polish UI/UX (Phase 4)
   - Priority: Fix error messages
   - Goal: App feels professional

5. **Day 13-15**: Test everything (Phase 5)
   - Priority: Verify all fixes work
   - Goal: Ready for users

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Backend doesn't support needed endpoints
**Mitigation**: Document what's needed, work around limitations

### Risk 2: Health upload format unknown
**Mitigation**: Reverse engineer from backend code if needed

### Risk 3: Time overrun
**Mitigation**: Focus on critical path, defer nice-to-haves

## Definition of Done

- [ ] User can login and see their profile
- [ ] Health data syncs automatically  
- [ ] Chat provides responses (even if limited)
- [ ] No generic error messages
- [ ] Dashboard shows real health metrics
- [ ] Settings page fully functional
- [ ] Background sync works
- [ ] Proper error handling throughout

## Notes

- This tracker should be updated daily
- Mark tasks complete as they're finished
- Add new issues as discovered
- Adjust timeline if needed
