CLARITY Pulse is a secure, HIPAA-compliant iOS health application designed to empower users by providing a comprehensive view of their health data and generating personalized, AI-driven insights.

## Overview

The application integrates directly with Apple's HealthKit to serve as a central dashboard for daily wellness metrics. Leveraging Firebase for secure authentication and a modern, reactive architecture built with SwiftUI, CLARITY Pulse aims to deliver a seamless and private user experience.

The core mission is to transform raw health data into actionable knowledge, helping users understand trends, patterns, and potential areas for improvement in their well-being.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

CLARITY Pulse is built on a modern, scalable, and testable architecture, embracing the latest standards in iOS development.

-   **Design Pattern**: MVVM + Clean Architecture
-   **UI Framework**: SwiftUI with the `@Observable` framework (iOS 17+)
-   **Data Persistence**: SwiftData for on-device storage
-   **Concurrency**: Swift Structured Concurrency (`async/await`)
-   **Dependency Injection**: Environment-based DI for loose coupling and testability

### Architectural Layers

The codebase is organized into distinct layers, ensuring a clear separation of concerns:

1.  **UI Layer (`Features/`, `UI/`)**: Contains SwiftUI Views, ViewModels, and reusable UI components. This layer is responsible for presentation and user interaction.
2.  **Domain Layer (`Domain/`)**: The business logic core. Contains Use Cases, domain models, and repository protocols (interfaces).
3.  **Data Layer (`Data/`)**: Implements the repository protocols. It handles the abstraction of data sources, containing repository implementations, Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), and services that communicate with the network or database.
4.  **Core Layer (`Core/`)**: Provides foundational services and utilities used across the application, such as networking, persistence controllers, and security services.

## ‚ú® Features

### Current Capabilities

-   **Secure User Authentication**: Full support for user registration and login, handled by Firebase Authentication.
-   **HealthKit Integration**: On-demand fetching of daily health metrics, including:
    -   Step Count
    -   Resting Heart Rate
    -   Sleep Analysis (Time in bed, time asleep)
-   **Main Dashboard**: A reactive dashboard that displays the latest health metrics and handles loading, empty, and error states gracefully.
-   **AI-Powered Insights**: A system for fetching and displaying an "Insight of the Day", designed to provide users with actionable feedback.
-   **Advanced Security & HIPAA Compliance**:
    -   **App Snapshot Blurring**: Automatically obscures the app's content in the iOS app switcher to protect Private Health Information (PHI).
    -   **Jailbreak Detection**: Detects if the application is running on a compromised (jailbroken) device and can warn the user.
    -   **Biometric Authentication**: Core service for Face ID / Touch ID is implemented.
    -   **Secure Session Management**: Core service for handling idle session timeouts is in place.

### Intended Future Capabilities

-   **Background HealthKit Sync**: Automatic, periodic synchronization of health data.
-   **Expanded Health Metrics**: Integration with a wider range of HealthKit data types (e.g., HRV, Blood Oxygen).
-   **Comprehensive Insight Engine**: Deeper analysis of health data using advanced AI/ML models.
-   **Push Notifications**: Secure, privacy-respecting notifications for new insights or important health events.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Xcode 16.0+
-   iOS 18.4+
-   An Apple Developer account (for HealthKit capabilities)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [repo-url]
    cd clarity-loop-frontend
    ```

2.  **Firebase Configuration**
    -   Set up a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    -   Add an iOS app to the project with the bundle identifier `com.novamindnyc.clarity-loop-frontend`.
    -   Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
    -   Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file into the `clarity-loop-frontend/Application/` directory in Xcode.

3.  **Xcode Project**
    -   Open `clarity-loop-frontend.xcodeproj`.
    -   Select your development team in the "Signing & Capabilities" tab for the `clarity-loop-frontend` target.
    -   Ensure the "HealthKit" and "Keychain Sharing" capabilities are enabled.

4.  **Build and Run**
    -   Select a physical iOS device or Simulator.
    -   Build and run the project (Cmd+R).

## üß™ Testing

The project includes two test targets:
-   `clarity-loop-frontendTests`: For unit and integration tests.
-   `clarity-loop-frontendUITests`: For UI automation tests.

**Note:** The test targets currently have known compilation issues due to outdated mock implementations. These must be resolved to ensure proper test coverage.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Current Status

### ‚úÖ **Authentication System**: FULLY RESOLVED 
All critical authentication bugs have been successfully fixed:
- ‚úÖ **@Observable Architecture**: Complete conversion from deprecated patterns
- ‚úÖ **SecureField Issues**: Custom implementation resolves AutoFill conflicts
- ‚úÖ **Navigation**: Modern NavigationStack usage throughout
- ‚úÖ **Memory Management**: Proper ViewModel lifecycle management
- ‚úÖ **Text Input**: Functional password and email fields

**Status**: Production-ready authentication system ‚ú®

### üü° **Remaining Areas for Improvement**:
-   **Background Data Sync**: The app only fetches HealthKit data when it is active. Background synchronization is not yet implemented.
-   **Test Target Compilation**: Unit test targets need manual fixes in Xcode (compilation errors prevent external editor modifications).
-   **Documentation Sync**: Several audit documents (`AUTH_CRITICAL_AUDIT_REPORT.md`, etc.) now contain outdated information since issues have been resolved.

### üì± **Current Focus**: Real Device Testing
The authentication system is now stable and ready for real device testing with HealthKit data integration.
