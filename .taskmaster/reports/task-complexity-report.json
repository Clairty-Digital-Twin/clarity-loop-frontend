		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Update Authentication Tests and Validation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the authentication test refactoring into specific test categories: unit tests for token handling, integration tests for auth flow, mock setup for backend responses, error scenario testing, performance testing, and test coverage validation. Each subtask should focus on a specific aspect of the testing strategy.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves comprehensive test refactoring across multiple authentication scenarios, requiring careful mock setup, various test types (unit, integration, performance), and ensuring complete coverage. The complexity comes from needing to understand both the old Cognito flow and new backend flow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Missing Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize DTO implementation by service domain: HealthKit DTOs (sample, upload request/response, status), Health Data DTOs (upload, response), PAT Analysis DTOs (step data, actigraphy, analysis responses), and Insights Service DTOs (status, model info). Each subtask should include implementation, Codable conformance, and unit tests.",
			"reasoning": "While DTO implementation is straightforward, the task requires creating numerous DTOs across multiple service domains with exact API contract matching. The complexity comes from the volume of DTOs and ensuring proper Codable implementation with comprehensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Complete API Endpoints Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide endpoint implementation by service: Authentication endpoints (refresh, logout, user management), HealthKit endpoints (upload, status), Health Data endpoints (upload, processing), PAT Analysis endpoints (analyze, retrieve), and Insights endpoints (get insights, service status). Each subtask should include async/await implementation, error handling, and unit tests.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to implementing multiple API endpoints across different services, each requiring proper async/await patterns, JWT token handling, error management, and comprehensive testing. The interdependencies between endpoints add to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Dashboard Data Loading and Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: ViewState pattern implementation, empty state UI components creation, simulator vs device handling logic, onboarding flow for new users, and reactive UI updates with @Observable. Each subtask should address a specific aspect of the dashboard user experience.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing a comprehensive state management pattern, creating multiple UI states, handling platform differences, and ensuring smooth user experience. The complexity comes from coordinating multiple UI states and handling various data scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Complete HealthKit Integration with Background Sync",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: HealthKit authorization flow implementation, HKObserverQuery setup for real-time updates, background delivery configuration, BGProcessingTask implementation, BGAppRefreshTask setup, health metric fetching logic, and simulator/device compatibility handling. Each subtask should be self-contained with proper error handling.",
			"reasoning": "HealthKit integration is inherently complex, involving multiple iOS frameworks, background processing, real-time data observation, and handling platform differences. The task requires deep iOS knowledge and careful implementation of background tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement PAT Analysis Visualization Feature",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: SwiftUI Charts integration for hypnogram, PATAnalysisViewModel with state management, confidence score visualization components, clinical insights display, polling mechanism for status updates, and SwiftData caching implementation. Focus on creating reusable chart components and smooth user interactions.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex data visualization with SwiftUI Charts, state management for analysis workflows, real-time polling, and local caching. The complexity comes from creating interactive charts and managing asynchronous analysis states."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Gemini AI Insights and Chat Feature",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: InsightsListView with pagination, InsightsListViewModel implementation, 'Insight of the Day' card component, ChatView with message bubbles UI, ChatViewModel for real-time messaging, and SwiftData integration for offline storage. Each subtask should focus on specific UI/UX aspects and data flow.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a chat interface with AI integration is complex, requiring real-time updates, pagination, rich content display, and offline support. The task involves sophisticated UI components and asynchronous data handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Implement SwiftData Persistence Layer",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize by entity type: HealthMetricEntity implementation, InsightEntity creation, PATAnalysisEntity setup, DTO-to-Entity mapping functions, and sync timestamp/encryption implementation. Each subtask should include entity definition, relationships, and HIPAA compliance measures.",
			"reasoning": "SwiftData implementation requires careful entity design, relationship management, and data mapping. The complexity increases with HIPAA compliance requirements and sync timestamp handling for conflict resolution."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Data Synchronization Manager",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: SyncManager service architecture, offline queue implementation, NWPathMonitor network monitoring, retry logic with exponential backoff, sync status UI indicators, background sync coordination, and conflict resolution logic. Each subtask should handle specific sync scenarios and edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "Data synchronization is inherently complex, involving offline support, network monitoring, retry mechanisms, and conflict resolution. The task requires sophisticated state management and coordination between local and remote data sources."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Background Task Scheduling",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: BGProcessingTask configuration for bulk uploads, BGAppRefreshTask for periodic sync, Info.plist and AppDelegate setup, background task expiration handling, and HealthKit observer notification integration. Each subtask should focus on specific iOS background processing requirements.",
			"reasoning": "Background task implementation is complex due to iOS system limitations, proper task registration, and handling various background scenarios. The task requires deep understanding of iOS background processing APIs and careful resource management."
